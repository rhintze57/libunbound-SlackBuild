# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libunbound: 
libunbound: Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver.
libunbound: It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features
libunbound: based on open standards.  To help increase online privacy, Unbound  
libunbound: supports DNS-over-TLS which allows clients to encrypt their 
libunbound: communication. In addition, it supports various modern standards 
libunbound: that limit the amount of data exchanged with authoritative servers.
libunbound: These standards dont only improve privacy but also help making the  
libunbound: DNS more robust. The most important are Query Name Minimisation,
libunbound: the Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache and support for 
libunbound: authority zones, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.
